# HP 48 Programs

A collection of programs for flight planning and navigation using the classic HP48GX calculator. These were developed by me in the 90s for use during basic flight training. At the time I knew only high school math, had no good academic references for formulas, no knowledge of numerics, and did not know much about software developement. In other words, the programs should not be considered correct or accurate and should not be used for real-life navigation or planning. That said, I did use them myself to great benefit.
